Facebook-Album-Downloader-Parallel
==================================

Downloads pictures from Facebook albums of a specific user. Uses multiprocessing to download pictures in parallel.
Downloading the pictures in parallel seemed to produce a speed increase of around a factor of 10 from the original non-parallel implementation.

##Usage:

Simply run the fbalbumdownload.py with the other files from the repo in the same directory and enter the required information at the prompt.

Alternatively, you can use some of the commandline arguments which can be viewed by typing fbalbumdownload.py -h
